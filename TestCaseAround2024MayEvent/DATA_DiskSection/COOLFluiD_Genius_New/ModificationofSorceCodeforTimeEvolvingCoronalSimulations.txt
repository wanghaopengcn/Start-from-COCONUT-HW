Part 1. In the "src\Framework" folder, the following code files have been modified for time-evolving simulations.
1. NodalStatesExtrapolator.ci
You need to modify this file in the sections marked with the the following comments, as described in the the manu:
"case-dependent_1", "case-dependent_2", "case-dependent_3", "case-dependent_4", and "case-dependent_5".

2. NodalStateExtrapolator.hh  2024.05.14
Between Lines 224 and 226, Haopeng Wang  added the following declaration, which also work for linear interpolation.
void readSurfaceDataextrapolator(std::vector<SurfaceData*>& surfaces,
		       const std::string& fileName, const std::string& fileName2,
			   double Coefi1, double Coefi2);	

3. ConvergenceMethod.cxx
Between Lines 447 and 455, Haopeng Wang transferd the time from code unite to physical unite in hours and print it to the output dialog.
L450 modified 'out << subSysStatus->getCurrentTimeDim();' to 'out << subSysStatus->getCurrentTimeDim()*1447.2/3600.0;'
L454 modified 'out << subSysStatus->getDTDim();' to 'out << subSysStatus->getDTDim()*1447.2/3600.0;'.

4. PathAppender.cxx 
Between Lines 113 and 115, Haopeng Wang transfered code unite to physical unite in hours.
L113     CFreal physicaltime = time*1447.2/3600.0;
L114     physicaltime=int(physicaltime*100.0)/100.0;
L115     std::string time_string = Common::StringOps::to_str(physicaltime);

5. SubSystemStatus.cxx
Between Lines 222 and 227, Haopeng Wang defined the start time in physical hour and then transfer it to code unite. It is related to "SubSystemStatusStack::getActive()->getCurrentTimeDim()"
L222 CFreal restarttime = 0.0
L227 return (PhysicalModelStack::getActive()->getImplementor()->getRefTime())*m_currentTime+restarttime*1447.2/3600.0;

With help from Andrea, this currently can be done in the CFcase, therefore no longer need to modify this file.

Part 2. In the "Plugins\FiniteVolume" folder, the following code files have been modified for time-evolving simulations.
1. HLLFlux.cxx
Between Lines 96 and 119, Haopeng Wang  defined the parameter "alpha" for self-adjustable dispation term of HLL.
corresponding modifications are added between the comments started with "mark".

Part 3. In the "Plugins\FiniteVolumeMHD" folder, the following code files have been modified for time-evolving simulations.
1. SuperInletProjectionConstrained.hh
In Line 69, Haopeng Wang added "virtual void preProcess();"
In Line 83, Haopeng Wang comment "Common::CFMap<Framework::TopologicalRegionSet*, RealVector*> m_mapTrs2Twall;" 

2. SuperInletProjectionConstrained.cxx
It corresponding to the innerboundary conditions described in the time-evolving COCONUT paper.
Pay attention the difinition of  maxvA, currently it is defined as "CFreal maxvA = 3.0e6;", but it can also be changed to "CFreal maxvA = 3.0e6;" for solar minimum.

3. SuperInletProjection.hh
In line 65, Andrea added "virtual void preProcess();".

4. SuperInletProjection.cxx
Between Lines 343 and 354, Andrea defined the "virtual void preProcess();" function.

5. CMakelists.txt
Since "SuperInletProjectionConstrained.hh", "SuperInletProjectionConstrained.cxx", "SuperInletProjectionConstrainedST.hh", "SuperInletProjectionConstrainedST.cxx", "SuperInletProjectionConstrainedMichaela", and "SuperInletProjectionConstrainedMichaela" are newly developed files, you should add the following commands to "CMakelists.txt" file.
"
SuperInletProjectionConstrained.cxx
SuperInletProjectionConstrained.hh
SuperInletProjectionConstrainedST.cxx
SuperInletProjectionConstrainedST.hh
SuperInletProjectionConstrainedMichaela.cxx
SuperInletProjectionConstrainedMichaela.hh
".

6. Venktn3DStrict.cxx
Between Lines 185 and 186 Haopeng Wang comment out "psimin = min(psi, psimin);" and added "psimin = 1.0;".

7. MHDConsACASourceTerm.cxx 
Between Lines 329 and 494: Haopeng Wang changed the rediative cooling curve from Rosner1978 to chiant 9.
Lines 357-494 Haopeng Wang added the radiattive loss function derived from chiant 9. Correspondingly, Lines 329 and 353 are commented out.

Part 4. In the "Plugins\NewtonMethod" folder, the following code files have been modified for time-evolving simulations and enhanced numerical stability.
1. BDF2.cxx
In Lines 148 and 149, Haopeng Wang changed "(m_data->freezeJacobian() && k > 1) ? m_data->setDoComputeJacobFlag(false) : m_data->setDoComputeJacobFlag(true);" 
to (m_data->freezeJacobian() && (k > 1) && (k % 4 != 0)) ? m_data->setDoComputeJacobFlag(false) : m_data->setDoComputeJacobFlag(true);

2. "StdUpdateSolPP.cxx" and "StdUpdateSolPP.cxx" are newly developed files, thererfore in "CMakeLists.txt" file, you should include the following lines:
"
StdUpdateSolPP.hh
StdUpdateSolPP.cxx
".

3. UpdateSolMHD.cxx
There are also some modification in "UpdateSolMHD.cxx", given that we didn't need to use it, don't pay attention to the modifications here.

Part 5. In the "Plugins\TecplotWriter" folder, the following code files have been modified for time-evolving simulations.
1. ParWriteSolutionBlock.cxx 
Line 546 Haopeng Wang transfer the time unit from code unit to physical hour
Line 546 CFreal timeDim = SubSystemStatusStack::getActive()->getCurrentTimeDim()*1447.2/3600.0;
In Line 503 Haopeng Wang tried to comment "cf_assert(tt.nodesOffset[iType].second == maxpos);" to avoid exit while saving data.

2. WriteSolutionBlockFV.cxx 
transfer code unites to physical unites in output files.
Line 248 CFreal solutiontime = subSysStatus->getCurrentTimeDim() > 0 ? subSysStatus->getCurrentTimeDim()*1447.2/3600.0 : subSysStatus->getNbIter();
Line 268 << ", AUXDATA PhysTime=\"" << subSysStatus->getCurrentTimeDim()*1447.2/3600.0 << "\""
Line 699 CFreal solutiontime = subSysStatus->getCurrentTimeDim() > 0 ? subSysStatus->getCurrentTimeDim()*1447.2/3600.0 : subSysStatus->getNbIter();
