We recommend reviewing the introductory documents in the eDocument folder, which provide background and development of this model, before proceeding.

You can directly upload the files from the first four folders into the corresponding directories in the plugins folder of the Master version of COCONUT you just installed. 

Before recompile, you need to open the already replaced files, add a space in any blank area, and then save them. This will ensure the replaced files are recognized as modified and will be recompiled.

ScriptDecE and scriptMaster contain job submission scripts corresponds to COCONUT adopting decomposed and full energy equations.

The folder “TestCaseAround2024MayEvent” contains the complet COCONUT files related to the paper Haopeng Wang, Stefaan Poedts, Andrea Lani et al. (2025): “Time-evolving coronal modelling of the solar maximum around the solar storms in May 2024 by COCONUT, A&A, 1–11”.

The post-processing code “result_drawing_COCONUT_Seq.f90” is also included in the directory “TestCaseAround2024MayEvent\Scratch_DiskSection\COCONUT_Map\results-map-res\30Rs_lv6\Timeevolving\fullMHD\2024.”
